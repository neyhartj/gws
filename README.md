# gws
A package to perform genomic or genome-wide selection.

## Author
Jeff Neyhart

## Introduction
This package provides easy-to-use functions for conducting genomic prediction. 
There are other packages that provide functions to solve mixed models in the
context of genomic selection, and this package builds on some but in a way that
is hopefully easier to use. Functions include those for cross-validation, marker
matrix filtering, etc.

## Installation
