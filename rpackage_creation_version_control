## Creating a new R package in Rstudio

Unlike other projects with GitHub, it is often easier to create the package locally
then begin version control.

First navigate to the directory in which you want to create the package

```
setwd("C:/Users/Jeff/Google Drive/")
```

Next use devtools to create the folder for the package. This creates the necessary 
starting files like the `DESCRIPTION` and `NAMESPACE`.

```
devtools::create("newpackage")
```

Go to GitHub and create a new repository, BUT WITHOUT THE README OR LICENSE.

Now click on Tools > Shell to open a shell terminal. Initiate the git repository
by moving to the package directory.

```
git init

git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
```

Grab the remote repository URL from GitHub

```
git remote add origin _remote repository_
